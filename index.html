        <h3>What is the connection between supply and demand</h3>
        <p>The law of demand states that when the supply of a particular object is high it's demandwill be low, likewise when an object's supply is very low it's demand will be very high</p>
        <br>
        <p>Supply refers to the amount of goods that are available. ... At some point, too much of a demand for the product will cause the supply to diminish. As a result, prices will rise. The product will then become too expensive, demand will go down at that price and the price will fall</p>
